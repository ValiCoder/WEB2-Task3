## WEB2 Assignment3

I started by adding mongoose to connect to my mongoDB

I added registration, login and user's main page

When user registers, his entry goes to mongoDB. Then when he goes to login or to his main page it gets retrieved from there. All the screenshots you might need are included into
the PDF document submitted

I'm so tired. I will be doing some work on frontend, as it looks like trash now, have to add some CSS. 

Screenshots:
